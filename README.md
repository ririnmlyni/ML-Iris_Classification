# Iris Plants Classification - Machine Learning

## Project Overview
### Introducion 
This project focuses on processing the **Iris Plants** dataset using the **Random Forest** algorithm in **machine learning**, where various features of iris flowers are analyzed to explore patterns and relationships within the data. The dataset consists of measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, which serve as key attributes in building a robust model.
