# Iris Plants Classification - Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on processing the **Iris Plants** dataset using the **Random Forest** algorithm in **machine learning**, where various features of iris flowers are analyzed to explore patterns and relationships within the data. The dataset consists of measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, which serve as key attributes in building a robust model.

## Dataset Characteristics
● Number of Instances: 150 
● Number of Attributes: 4 numeric, predictive attributes and the class
● Attribute Information:
  ◦ sepal length in cm
  ◦ sepal width in cm
  ◦ petal length in cm
  ◦ petal width in cm
● Class:
  ◦ Iris-Setosa
  ◦ Iris-Versicolour
  ◦ Iris-Virginica
  
## Goals
This project aims to analyze patterns in the *Iris Plants* dataset and develop a machine learning model using *Random Forest* to accurately classify flower species based on their size characteristics.

## Model Evaluation
● Confusion Matrix to measure prediction accuracy  
● Feature Importance Analysis to identify the most influential features  
● Correlation Matrix to understand relationships between features

## Insight
✔ **High Accuracy** – The Random Forest algorithm can classify the three iris flower species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) with a high level of accuracy.
✔ **Most Influential Features** – Based on Feature Importance analysis, petal length and petal width contribute the most to distinguishing iris species.
✔ **Feature Relationships** – Correlation analysis shows that petal features have a stronger relationship with species classification compared to sepal features, making the classification process more efficient.
✔ **Stable and Reliable Model** – Random Forest reduces the risk of overfitting compared to single decision tree models, resulting in a more stable and reliable model for predicting new data.
